Military Purpose Robot Using Arduino Uno R3

The project is design to Military Purpose Robot using some different type of sensors for its movement. Arduino uno and different ICs used to achieve the desired operation. Monitoring a group of circumstances, a region, or a person is the task of surveillance. This typically happens in a military setting where monitoring enemy territory, hostage situations, or conflict zones is essential to a country's security. A surveillance robot is a semi automated machine that follows instructions, gathers necessary data, strives to reach its target, and streams or captures photos that can be examined by the operator while avoiding obstacles. Our goal in this Project is to offer a solution or example for a wirelessly controlled robot vehicle that can recognise an object, gauge how far away a human is from the vehicle, and wirelessly feed video of its surroundings to the operatored and detects landmines using a metal detector coil. Once detected the vehicle transmits the GPS location of the landmine over an SMS to the registered phone number so that the mine locations can be mapped.
